# Reading_List_Project

INTRO:
If you are an avid reader, you might have an extensive READING LIST. A LIST that is continously added to and updated as you run across mentions of good books to read.

My LIST has been growing and shrinking as I add books I intend to read or remove once I've read them.

The method that I maintain my list has started to become an irritant. When I run across a reference to a book I wish to add to my READING LIST, I open up an email that I continously email to myself and simply add the book to the list. So in essence I'm constantly searching for, updating, and emailing myself the same email thread that has my READING LIST.

This project is the first iterration of a simple reading list that I can maintain (i.e. add to, remove from, etc).
